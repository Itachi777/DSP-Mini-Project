# DSP-Mini-Project
Using MATLAB to Measure the Diameter of an Object within an Image.

Summary: -
Measuring objects within an image or frame can be an important capability for many applications where computer vision is required instead of making physical measurements. This application note will cover a basic step-by-step algorithm for isolating a desired object and measuring its diameter.

Note: - I was able to implement this project based on a PDF that I found on the Internet and the Author of that PDF was "Matthew Wesolowski"
